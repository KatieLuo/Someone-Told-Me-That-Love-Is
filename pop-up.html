        Someone told me that love is…  is exactly that—a website about love and all the different things that people have told me love is. Recently, I have been collecting some soft data on what the people around me think love is. I want to better understand what love is to the people around me—love all encompassing, not just romantic—and how each person has come to this explanation. Love is an endless exploration, constantly shifting and evolving to meet current needs and wants. Similarly, I want people to explore this website by scrolling to see the full and various definitions. As you scroll horizontally and vertically, the text shifts along the path a little depending on the direction. Currently, the limitations is my dataset as I have only asked a numbered amount of people; however, I hope to continue collecting more answers as I continue this inquiry. As you continue to read Overall, this website is meant to be fun and playful and perhaps spark some curiosity for you to go out and ask the people around you the same question. What is love?
